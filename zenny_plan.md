## 1. Introduction

Zenny is a customer service platform inspired by Zendesk. The goal is to build a minimal-yet-robust solution using:
- Supabase (for database, authentication, and optional file storage)
- React (for the frontend UI)
- LangChain + pgvector (for AI-assisted features and advanced knowledge base searching)
- AWS Amplify (for hosting)

Our main objective is to limit external service dependencies while maintaining scalability and essential features like ticket management, agent-dashboard, knowledge base, and AI-assisted operations.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Single-page application that handles the UI: ticket creation, updates, and agent dashboards.

2. **Backend & Database (Supabase, pgvector, and optional Node microservice)**  
   - Leverage Supabase Postgres to store application data (tickets, users, articles).  
   - Use pgvector extension for storing and querying embeddings.  
   - Supabase handles user authentication through JWT tokens.  
   - Optionally, use a minimal Node or serverless function layer (AWS Lambda/Amplify Functions) if advanced logic is needed.

3. **AI/LLM Layer (LangChain)**  
   - Use LangChain to interface with an external LLM (OpenAI or Anthropic).  
   - Generate/consume embeddings for knowledge base articles and advanced ticket-level suggestions.

4. **Hosting (AWS Amplify)**  
   - Amplify to host the entire React application.  
   - You can also manage environment variables and set up serverless functions as needed in Amplify.

5. **Storage**  
   - Supabase’s built-in object storage for file attachments.  
   - Alternatively, use AWS S3 if you prefer to keep everything on AWS.

## 3. Detailed Features

### 3.1 Ticket Management
- **Ticket Creation & Management**  
  - Users submit new tickets describing their issue (title, description, priority).  
  - Agents can reply to tickets, change status, reassign tickets to other agents.
- **Status & Priority**  
  - Basic statuses: Open, Pending, Closed.  
  - Priority levels: Low, Medium, High.
- **Faceted Searches & Filters**  
  - Filter by status, date ranges, keywords, user, etc.
- **Comments & Activity Log**  
  - Users and agents can comment on a ticket.  
  - Each ticket has a chronological activity log to track updates.

### 3.2 Knowledge Base
- **Article Management**  
  - Store articles in Supabase.  
  - Agents or Admins can create, edit, or remove knowledge base articles.  
- **Vector Search with pgvector**  
  - Embeddings are stored and used for semantic search.  
  - Query for relevant articles based on ticket descriptions or user queries.

### 3.3 AI-Assisted Features
- **Ticket Summarization & Suggested Responses**  
  - When an agent opens a ticket, use LangChain + an LLM to generate a quick summary or possible solution.  
  - Suggest relevant knowledge base articles or templated responses.
- **Knowledge Base Insights**  
  - AI can cluster related articles or highlight missing docs on frequently asked topics.

### 3.4 User & Agent Roles
- **Users**  
  - End-users can submit tickets, track their own tickets, and view the knowledge base.  
- **Agents**  
  - Agents see all tickets, manage them, and update statuses.  
  - Access to knowledge base authoring capabilities (optional or restricted to editors).  
- **Admin**  
  - Manage user roles, system configurations, advanced reporting.
- Agents can see all tickets, update statuses, and manage the Knowledge Base.
- Admins have full access to user and platform settings.

### 3.5 Notifications
- **Email Alerts**  
  - On new ticket creation, user receives a confirmation email.  
  - Agents can optionally receive email notifications.  
- **Real-Time Updates (Optional)**  
  - Supabase real-time features could be leveraged to reflect ticket status changes without manual refresh.

### 3.6 Deployment & Environment Clarification
We will maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production to ensure smooth rollouts:
- **Development Environment**:
  - Supabase free-tier project for local testing.
  - Amplify environment variables pointing to the dev database and dev LLM usage (lower usage limit or test keys).
- **Staging Environment**:
  - Used before production deployment to test new features with dummy or masked data.
  - Amplify environment variables pointing to the staging Supabase project.
  - Potentially a separate model or endpoint for the LLM to ensure stable testing.
- **Production Environment**:
  - Uses the main Supabase project with paid tiers as required.
  - Amplify environment variables pointing to production keys, allowing higher concurrency.
  - Monitored carefully with usage-based alerts for LLM calls.

When switching from staging to production, we will:
1. Commit final changes to the main branch.
2. Configure Amplify to build from main branch with production environment variables.
3. Run any necessary database migrations in Supabase to keep schema consistent.

## 4. Database Schema (Supabase + pgvector)

1. **Tables**  
   - **Users** `(id, email, role, created_at, updated_at, etc.)`  
   - **Tickets** `(id, user_id, title, description, status, priority, created_at, updated_at, etc.)`  
   - **Ticket_Comments** `(id, ticket_id, user_id, comment_text, created_at, etc.)`  
   - **KnowledgeBase** `(id, title, content, created_at, updated_at, etc.)`  
     - You can add an `embedding_vector` column if you want to store embeddings in the same table, or store them in a separate table called **KnowledgeBaseVectors**.
   - **KnowledgeBaseVectors** `(article_id, content_embedding vector(1536), etc.)` if separate from the main table.

2. **Relations**  
   - `Tickets.user_id → Users.id`  
   - `Ticket_Comments.ticket_id → Tickets.id`  
   - `Ticket_Comments.user_id → Users.id` (or could be null if you allow anonymous comments, but best practice is to enforce user ownership)  
   - `KnowledgeBaseVectors.article_id → KnowledgeBase.id`

3. **Row-Level Security**  
   - Enable RLS on the Tickets table to restrict non-agent users to seeing only their own tickets.

4. **pgvector Setup**  
   - Confirm that the pgvector extension is enabled in your Supabase Project (under Database > Extensions).
   - For a given `embedding_vector`, you can create indexes for KNN or approximate similarity search.

---

## 5. LangChain Integration

1. **Embedding Generation & Indexing**  
   - Use an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002`) to generate embeddings for new or updated knowledge base articles.  
   - Store these embeddings in the `KnowledgeBaseVectors` table with the article ID.

2. **Semantic Search**  
   - When a user or agent initiates a search, generate an embedding for the search query.  
   - Perform a similarity search in Postgres:
     ```sql
     SELECT article_id
     FROM KnowledgeBaseVectors
     ORDER BY embedding_vector <-> query_embedding
     LIMIT 5;
     ```
   - Use the returned article IDs to display the corresponding knowledge base articles.

3. **Ticket Summaries**  
   - For an existing ticket, pass the ticket’s text to the LLM for summarization.  
   - Consider caching or storing the summary to reduce repeated calls.

4. **Suggested Responses**  
   - Provide the user’s question and relevant knowledge base excerpts to the LLM.  
   - The LLM can propose a draft agent response, which the agent can edit and send.

## 6. React Frontend Implementation

1. **Project Structure Example**  
   ```
   src/
     components/
       TicketList.jsx
       TicketDetail.jsx
       KnowledgeBase.jsx
       ...
     pages/
       Dashboard.jsx
       Login.jsx
       Register.jsx
       ...
     services/
       supabaseClient.js
       langchainService.js
     App.js
     index.js
     ...
   ```

2. **Authentication**  
   - Use the Supabase JavaScript client to handle sign-in/sign-up flows.  
   - Keep track of current user’s auth status in a React context or global state.

3. **User Dashboard**  
   - Upon login, let users see their tickets.  
   - “Create Ticket” button triggers a form for subject, description, and optional attachments.

4. **Agent Dashboard**  
   - Agents can list all tickets, filter by status or priority.  
   - Clicking on a ticket shows the conversation, allows agent replies.

5. **Knowledge Base UI**  
   - A simple search bar.  
   - Show the top relevant articles (fuzzy matched via embeddings).  
   - Option to open an article detail page to read or edit.

6. **Styling & Components**  
   - Consider a UI library (Material UI, TailwindCSS, or Chakra UI) to accelerate development.  
   - Create components for ticket previews, lists, modals, search bars, etc.

## 7. AWS Amplify Deployment

1. **Setting Up AWS Amplify**  
   - From the command line in your React project:  
     ```
     amplify init
     amplify add hosting
     amplify publish
     ```
   - Configure the Amplify project to connect to your Git repository for CI/CD.

2. **Environment Variables**  
   - In the Amplify console, under “Environment variables,” add:  
     - SUPABASE_URL  
     - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
     - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (if needed for privileged operations)  
     - OPENAI_API_KEY (or other LLM keys)
   - Reference these values in React via process.env (after building, Amplify injects them).

3. **Amplify Functions (Optional)**  
   - If you don’t want a separate server, you can add functions (Lambda) to handle advanced interactions or background tasks (like emailing).  
   - Keep in mind you’ll need to manage application logic to connect to Supabase from within these functions.

---

## 8. Security & Best Practices

1. **Storing Secrets**  
   - Keep .env local for development.  
   - Use Amplify environment variables in production builds.

2. **Access Control**  
   - Supabase row-level security ensures that end users can only see their own tickets.  
   - Agents have expanded privileges, enforced through RLS policies or separate API routes.

3. **Input Validation**  
   - Implement client-side checks (React) and server-side checks (Supabase triggers, stored procedures, or your Node layer).

4. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**  
   - If hosting a public route for LLM requests, consider usage-based or IP-based rate limiting.

5. **Monitoring**  
   - Consider integrating AWS CloudWatch or a third-party monitoring service for logs and alerts.

---

## 9. Performance & Scalability

1. **Database Indexes**  
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns (ticket status, user_id, etc.).  
   - Use a vector index for the embedding column to speed up searches in pgvector.

2. **Caching**  
   - Cache the results of the most common queries to reduce repeated LLM calls and DB requests.

3. **Scaling Supabase**  
   - Supabase offers storage tiers. You can upgrade if you reach resource or concurrency limits.

4. **Scaling React & Amplify**  
   - Amplify scales the frontend hosting automatically.  
   - For serverless functions, you can leverge concurrency configurations for Lambdas.

---

## 10. Optional Enhancements

1. **Live Chat**  
   - Real-time chat between users and agents, leveraging Supabase’s real-time API or a separate socket-based approach.

2. **Multi-Language Support**  
   - Use a multilingual embedding model.  
   - Localize your UI strings and knowledge base articles.

3. **Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Collect metrics on ticket volume, average response time, user satisfaction.  
   - Display in an admin dashboard.

4. **Integration Points**  
   - Slack or MS Teams integration for agent notifications.  
   - External CRM integration for user contact details.
