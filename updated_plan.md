# Updated Development Plan

Based on Our Updated Requirements and Current Progress

This document outlines our revised plan to implement the remaining features of our customer service and ticket-management system (AutoCRM). We will continue leveraging our React frontend, Supabase for the backend/database, and AWS Amplify for hosting and deployment.

---

## 1. Introduction

We have already established a foundation: a ticket system with basic CRUD operations, a knowledge base, and preliminary analytics. We will now expand these components to meet the latest requirements. Key goals are:

1. A robust, flexible ticket data model that captures the entire customer interaction journey.  
2. An API-first design enabling high scalability, integration, and automation.  
3. An employee interface that streamlines ticket handling for agents and admins.  
4. Administrative controls for team management, routing intelligence, and security policies.  
5. A comprehensive customer portal with self-service features.  
6. Data management strategies (migrations, archival, performance optimization).  
7. Extended performance tools, multi-channel support, and advanced analytics.  

We plan to address these areas iteratively to ensure smooth development and deployment via AWS Amplify.

## 2. Core Architecture & Data Model

### 2.1 Ticket Data Model

• **Standard Fields**  
  - Ticket ID, creation date, status, priority, updated_at.  
  - Full conversation history, including message content and timestamps.

• **Flexible Metadata**  
  - Dynamic status tracking to reflect real workflows.  
  - Priority levels (e.g., low, medium, high).  
  - Custom fields specific to different business scenarios (e.g., SLA type, region).  
  - Tags for automated routing and categorization.  
  - Internal notes for internal collaboration among agents.  

• **Implementation Details**  
  - Use Supabase migrations to add new columns (tags, internal notes, etc.) and maintain version control.  
  - Leverage Row-Level Security (RLS) to control read/write access for different roles (users, agents, admins).  
  - Build or refine database triggers (e.g., "update_updated_at_column") to capture changes or logs for analytics.

---

## 3. API-First Approach

• **Endpoints & Integrations**  
  - Provide RESTful endpoints via either Supabase edge functions or custom Amplify serverless functions.  
  - Support synchronous operations (creating tickets, updating statuses, fetching metadata).  
  - Include webhooks for event-driven updates (e.g., new ticket creation, ticket status changes).

• **Security & Permissioning**  
  - Implement granular permission checks with API key–based authentication for third-party integrations.  
  - Combine with Supabase RLS to ensure only appropriate data is returned for each request.

• **Automation**  
  - Enable external services to hook in via webhooks and scheduled tasks.  
  - Potentially use Amplify Functions for tasks such as sending notifications (email, Slack, etc.) when certain ticket triggers occur.

---

## 4. Feature Rollout & Timeline

The following sections describe each major feature, target timeframes, and implementation details. We have reordered and enriched content from previous versions to further clarify our execution plan.

### 4.1 Week 1–2: Finalize Core Ticketing & API Foundation

1. **Ticket Data Model Enhancements**  
   - Finish implementing custom fields (status, tags, internal notes).  
   - Enforce RLS rules tailored to our roles (user, agent, admin).  

2. **API-First Infrastructure**  
   - Build out synchronous endpoints for ticket creation, updates, retrieval with pagination.  
   - Add webhooks for essential events (ticket created, assigned, status changed).  
   - Document these endpoints thoroughly for future integrations.

3. **Why First?**  
   - This establishes the stable framework for all upcoming features (Employee Interface, Customer Portal, Admin Tools, etc.).  
   - Avoids rework by ensuring a robust schema to accommodate advanced workflows.

### 4.2 Week 3–4: Employee Interface & Ticket Handling

1. **Queue Management & Custom Views**  
   - Expand the React dashboard to support dynamic "queues" (filters by status, priority, tags, assigned team).  
   - Provide customizable views so each agent can tailor their queue to their workflow.

2. **Real-Time Updates**  
   - Leverage Supabase's real-time API or a polling mechanism to automatically refresh ticket lists and statuses.  
   - Notify agents when they receive a new ticket or updated priority.

3. **Bulk Operations**  
   - Build a multi-select feature to update multiple tickets at once (e.g., close or assign to an agent).

4. **Ticket Handling Tools**  
   - Store conversation history in a discussion-like view.  
   - Integrate a rich text editor for responses.  
   - Allow quick responses (macros/templates) for frequently asked questions.

5. **Why Next?**  
   - Prioritizes the agent experience, ensuring efficient ticket resolution and less time wasted on manual tasks.  
   - Lays the groundwork for advanced performance analytics (tracking resolution times, agent productivity).

### 4.3 Week 5–6: Administrative Control & Team Management

1. **Team & Coverage Management**  
   - Admin can create teams, assign agents, and monitor coverage schedules (important for large support operations).  
   - Agents can belong to multiple teams or skill groups.

2. **Routing Intelligence**  
   - Basic rule-based assignment (by region, priority, or tags).  
   - Potentially extend to skills-based routing: match ticket tags or content to specialized agents.  
   - Implement load balancing logic to distribute tickets fairly among teams/time zones.

3. **Audit Logging & Archival**  
   - Refine triggers to log all changes (status changes, reassignments, etc.) in a separate audit table or logs.  
   - Plan archival strategy for older tickets to maintain performance (Supabase S3 storage or archiving mechanism).

4. **Schema Flexibility**  
   - Develop robust migration scripts for future expansions.  
   - Confirm that adding or removing custom fields can be done with minimal downtime.

5. **Why Here?**  
   - Administrative tools are crucial for maintaining and scaling the system.  
   - Ensures managers have oversight on performance, coverage, and advanced control before the Customer Portal goes live.

### 4.4 Week 7–8: Customer Portal & Self-Service

1. **Customer Portal**  
   - Provide a secure, user-friendly React interface for customers to log in, create tickets, and track them.  
   - Pull full conversation history to enhance transparency.

2. **Self-Service Knowledge Base**  
   - Expand or refine the existing KB articles system, ensuring improved search.  
   - (Optional) Investigate an AI-powered chatbot (e.g., using a GPT-based model) to answer repetitive queries.  
   - Include step-by-step tutorials, FAQ sections, or a Quick Start guide.

3. **Notifications & Feedback**  
   - Manage notifications to customers when their tickets are updated or resolved.  
   - Collect customer ratings or feedback post-resolution.  
   - Log these metrics to feed into the analytics pipeline (e.g., satisfaction/CSAT scores).

4. **Why Now?**  
   - By this phase, internal operations (ticket workflows, admin controls) are already stable. Customers get a polished experience.  
   - Self-service reduces agent workload and fosters user independence.

### 4.5 Week 9+: Performance Optimization & Multi-Channel Support

1. **Performance Tuning & Advanced Analytics**  
   - Add more in-depth analytics: pivot tables, time-series metrics, agent performance dashboards.  
   - Integrate caching solutions (e.g., Redis or in-memory caching at the edge) if queries become heavy.

2. **Multi-Channel Support**  
   - Introduce chat widgets, social media integration, or SMS for ticket creation.  
   - Adjust data model or API endpoints to handle multi-channel contexts seamlessly.

3. **AI & Automation**  
   - If needed, refine AI-based routing or automation for repeated queries.  
   - Send proactive notifications based on user behavior (e.g., help suggestions if they visit certain pages).

4. **Internationalization**  
   - Provide multi-language support in both the Customer Portal and Knowledge Base.  
   - Use i18n libraries in React and store translations in Supabase or external services.

5. **Why Last?**  
   - These advanced features benefit from a stable, proven system with established data flows and user patterns.  
   - Delaying them until we have real operational data ensures we automate effectively.

## 5. Data Management & Performance Tools

• **Schema Migrations**  
  - Maintain well-documented SQL migrations in Supabase.  
  - Use incremental versioning with rollback options for safe deployments.

• **Archival & Maintenance**  
  - For large ticket volumes, implement a rolling archival plan (e.g., tickets older than 1 year).  
  - Store attachments in Supabase Storage or an S3 bucket for scalability.

• **Logging & Audit Trails**  
  - Expand the RLS setup to log all data changes (especially ticket reassignments, status changes, merges).  
  - Provide administrators with read-only access to full logs.  
  - Use Amplify logs for serverless function invocations and custom events.

• **Performance Monitoring**  
  - Track response times, resolution times, number of open vs. resolved tickets over time.  
  - Create personal agent dashboards with stats to foster self-improvement.  
  - Possibly integrate external monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, DataDog, or New Relic if usage grows significantly.

## 6. Technical Considerations

1. **React**  
   - Keep components modular and maintain a consistent UI/UX (possibly add a design system like Chakra UI).  
   - Foster reusability between agent-facing dashboards and the customer portal.

2. **Supabase**  
   - Leverage RLS for secure data partitioning across roles (user vs. agent vs. admin).  
   - Continue implementing triggers for auditing and data housekeeping.  
   - Evaluate and optimize queries (indexes on ticket status, user_id, tags, etc.).

3. **AWS Amplify**  
   - Manage environment variables for dev/staging/prod.  
   - Use Amplify's CI/CD pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments.  
   - Utilize Amplify Functions for complex logic, notifications, or third-party integrations.

---

## 7. Deployment & QA Strategy

• **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**  
  - Keep "main" for production.  
  - Use "develop" or feature-based branches.  
  - Require peer reviews, linting, and testing before merges.

• **Staging Environment**  
  - Mirror the production environment in staging for final user acceptance testing (UAT).  
  - Provide restricted access to internal testers and collect feedback.

• **Automated & Manual Testing**  
  - Write unit tests (React components, serverless functions).  
  - Add integration tests for critical flows (ticket creation, updates, real-time changes).  
  - Conduct manual UI tests to validate user experience across browsers/devices.

• **Observability & Logs**  
  - Supabase logs for database queries and triggers.  
  - Amplify logs/monitoring for functions, environment variables, and build steps.  
  - Potential integration with external logging or analytics platforms for advanced tracking.
